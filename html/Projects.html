                        Setting up a server was a fun microcosm of the real world. I built a bare metal tower with extra 
                        hardware I had lying around and tried to get it to serve a webpage. This led me through port-forwarding,
                        the agony of wireless linux, hardening a server to prevent simple malicious attacks, and how to setup 
                        Apache and a SQL distro. It took me a while but eventually I had a server (admittedly a terrible one) and
                        the setup process was a good introduction to Linux.

                        This was a highschool project that introduced the strengths of object-oriented programming. The Game
                        of Life is simple and dictates whether a square on a grid should be considered alive or dead. This setup
                        produces interesting stable structures such as gliders that perpetuate themselves after a few generations.
                        The translation to objects is easy and a lot of fun to implement. In addition to creating the base
                        simulation I also added code for the easy placement of stable structures. The simulator was written in processing
                        and can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kjlangen/HSProjects">github</a>.
