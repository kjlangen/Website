                    The University of Waterloo is STEM focused university located in Waterloo, Ontario. Waterloo provides one of the best Computer Science programs in Canada alongside the largest co-op program in the world. Currently I'm enrolled in both.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Math 135. An introductory course into mathematical proofs and techniques; this was done in the context of basic algebraic systems: integers, integers modulo n, rationals, reals and complex numbers.</li>
                        <li>Calculus 137. We studied reational, trigonometric, exponential, power, composite, and inverse functions. We were introduced to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the Reimann Integral, and antiderivatives.</li>
                        <li>Computer Science 135. An introduction to the fundamentals of computer science through the application of elementary programming patterns in a functional style. High level concepts covered data structures, recursion, abstraction and encapsulation.</li>

                        <li>Calculus 138. This class further studied methods and applications of integration. More advanced topics covered were convergence of sequences and series, functions defined as power series, Taylor polynomial and series, and parametric curves in R2.</li>
                        <li>Computer Science 136. This course made the transition from functional to imperative programming. It introduced the design and analysis of algorithms, management of information, and the mechanics and methodologies required to implement them. We studied data structures such as; lists, stacks, queues, trees, and abstract data types.</li>
