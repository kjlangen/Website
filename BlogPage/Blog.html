				<p class="content">
					So this will be my first blog post. Ever. Although I'm going to attempt proper grammer, I will probably fall woefully short.
					I wanted to take a minute of my time(to write this) and yours(to read this) to talk about promminent figures in computer science engaging
					in the act of blogging. I don't understand it at all. Blogging has a whole lot of flaws. In general, blogs are just torrents of peoples' un-edited thoughts.
					This makes reading the not-so-carefully crafted ones a chore. Furthermore, they are the thoughts of one and only one person. They haven't had the
					wisdom and perspective of an editor applied to them. This leads to skewed and cynical points of view that can be very harmful when taken personally.
					However, the central idea that really baffles me is not why people choose to engage in generally
					poor formats of writing, but why EVERYONE does it. The founder of Tesla motors blogs. The founder of Y Combinator blogs. Day[9], pro broadcaster and
					commentator, blogs. Upper year top-of-the-class students at my university blog. My brilliant friend interning at Google blogs! EVERYONE BLOGS.
					So you may be asking yourself, why is he blogging now too? Well, I'm going to leave those reasons for another post(the next one!). Bye for now!
